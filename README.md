You're the cryptocurrency keeper and you're on a mission to nab the most cryptocoins before getting grabbed by the skeletal hand of failure!

This game was built with SpriteKit and Swift. The graphics are provided courtesy of [MoonStar 2D](https://moonstar2d.itch.io/) and [Simirk Graphics](https://gameartpartners.com/vendor/simirk/). The awesome soundtrack is from [PandaPI](https://pandapi.bandcamp.com). 

# How to Play

Tap to start!

Time your jumps to make it over the big scary skeleton hand before it touches you. Every successful jump increases your score by 1.
Once the hand makes contact with you, the game is OVER! *sad trombone*
